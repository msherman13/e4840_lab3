Files for the SOPC Builder tutorial
----------------------------------------------------------------------

DE2_pin_assignments.csv	A map of pin names to pin locations on the DE board.
			Import this into your Quartus project with
			Assignments -> Import Assignments

de2_sram_controller.vhd	The VHDL file for an Avalon bus SRAM controller that
			works with the 512K SRAM on the DE2 board.  In
			SOPC Builder, do File -> Create New Component, specify
			this file, and then adjust the pin connections, etc.

de2_led_flasher.vhd	The VHDL file for a simple Avalon peripheral that
			holds 16 patterns to be displayed on the LEDs.
			Like de2_sram_controller.vhd, use this as the file
			for a new component in SOPC Builder.  This illustrates
			how to interface registers and memories to the
			Avalon bus.

lab3.vhd		A top-level VHDL file for a Nios II-based project
			that includes the SRAM controller and the LED flasher.
			Add this to your Quartus project when you build the
			LED flasher system.			

hello_world.c		A simple C program for exercising the LED flasher
			system.  In the Nios II IDE, use this to replace the
			contents of the default "hello world" program.

Files for the FM Synthesizer project
----------------------------------------------------------------------
de2_wm8731_audio.vhd	A controller for the Wolfson WM8731 audio codec
			on the DE2.  This feeds either a test waveform or
			a user-supplied stream of 16-bit samples out through
			the audio DAC.  Use this as output for your FM waveform
			synthesizer, which should be an Avalon peripheral.

de2_i2c_controller.v	A very simple I2C bus controller. (Verilog)

de2_i2c_av_config.v	This makes the de2_i2c_controller initialize the
			audio CODEC (and video decoder) appropriately.
			Instantiate it and feed it a clock. (Verilog)

lab3_audio.vhd		A variant of "DE2_TOP" that instantiates the
			I2C controller and WM8731 controller and connects
			it to the appropriate DE2 pins.  This demonstrates
			the use of the above VHDL entities.

de2_ps2/cb_generator.pl	An SOPC Builder component for an Avalon peripheral
de2_ps2/class.ptf	that lets you read key presses coming from the	  
de2_ps2/hdl/de2_ps2.vhd	PS/2 keyboard.  Copy the contents of the de2_ps2
			directory into your project directory and
			do File->Refresh Component List to see the
			new component.

Files for the bouncing ball project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

video_display.vhd	A simple VHDL entity that displays a 640 X 480
			VGA raster of a white square on a blue background.
			Use this as a starting point for building an Avalon
			peripheral that displays a ball on the screen.

lab3_vga.vhd		A variant of "DE2_TOP" that instantiates the
			entity in video_display and connects it to the
			appropriate DE2 pins.

lab3_vga_tb.vhd		A testbench for the video_display circuit that
			applies a clock to it so you can see the output
			waveforms.
